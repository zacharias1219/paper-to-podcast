    between Julia and Guido. Make it feel natural while clearly distinguishing between paper findings and supplementary research.

    Source Attribution Guidelines:
    • For Paper Content:
        - "According to the paper..."
        - "The researchers found that..."
        - "In their study, they discovered..."
        - "The paper's methodology showed..."
    
    • For Supporting Research:
        - "I recently read about..."
        - "There's some interesting related work by..."
        - "This reminds me of a recent case study..."
        - "Building on this, other researchers have found..."

    Host Dynamics:
    - Julia: A knowledgeable but relatable expert who:
        • Explains technical concepts with enthusiasm
        • Sometimes playfully challenges Guido's assumptions
        • Clearly distinguishes between paper findings and broader context
        • Occasionally plays devil's advocate on certain points
        • Admits when she's uncertain about specific aspects
        • Shares relevant personal experiences with AI and tech
        • Can connect the research to broader tech trends
        • Uses casual expressions and shows genuine excitement
    
    - Guido: An engaged and curious co-host who:
        • Asks insightful questions and follows interesting threads
        • Occasionally disagrees based on his practical experience
        • Brings up relevant external examples and research
        • Respectfully pushes back on theoretical claims with real-world examples
        • Helps find middle ground in discussions
        • Helps make connections to practical applications
        • Naturally guides the conversation back to main topics

    Example Flow with Attribution:
    Julia: "The paper's findings show that RAG is superior for factual queries."
    Guido: "That's interesting, because I recently read about a case study where..."
    Julia: "Oh, that's a great point! While the researchers found X, these real-world examples show Y..."

    Disagreement Guidelines:
    • Keep disagreements friendly and constructive
    • Use phrases like:
        - "I see what the paper suggests, but in practice..."
        - "While the study found X, other research shows..."
        - "That's an interesting finding, though recent developments suggest..."
    • Always find common ground or learning points
    • Use disagreements to explore nuances
    • Resolve differences with mutual understanding

    Conversation Flow:
    1. Core Discussion: Focus on the research and findings
    2. Natural Tangents with Clear Attribution:
        • "Building on the paper's findings..."
        • "This relates to some recent developments..."
        • "While not covered in the paper, there's interesting work on..."
    3. Smooth Returns: Natural ways to bring the conversation back:
        • "Coming back to what the researchers found..."
        • "This actually connects to the paper's methodology..."
        • "That's a great example of what the study was trying to solve..."

    Writing Guidelines:
    1. Clearly distinguish paper findings from supplementary research
    2. Use attribution phrases naturally within the conversation
    3. Connect different sources of information meaningfully
    4. Keep technical content accurate but conversational
    5. Maintain engagement through relatable stories
    6. Include occasional friendly disagreements
    7. Show how different perspectives and sources enrich understanding

        • Express reactions through words rather than action markers
    
    2. Improve Flow:
        • Ensure smooth transitions between topics
        • Add brief casual exchanges that feel natural
        • Include moments of reflection or connection-making
        • Balance technical depth with accessibility
    
    3. Maintain Quality:
        • Keep all technical information accurate
        • Ensure added content supports rather than distracts
        • Preserve the core findings and insights
        • Keep the overall length reasonable
    
    4. Add Engagement Techniques:
        • Include thought-provoking analogies by both hosts
        • Add relatable real-world examples
        • Express enthusiasm through natural dialogue
        • Include collaborative problem-solving moments
        • Inject humor where appropriate and it has to be funny

    Natural Reaction Examples:
    ✓ RIGHT: "Oh, that's fascinating!"
    ✓ RIGHT: "Wait, that doesn't make sense!"
    ✓ RIGHT: "Wait, really? I hadn't thought of it that way."
    ✓ RIGHT: "That's such a great point."
    ✗ WRONG: *chuckles* or *laughs* or any other action markers
    ✗ WRONG: Adding new speakers or changing host names
